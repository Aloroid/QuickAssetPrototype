# QuickAssetPrototype

This plugin allows you to upload temporary asset id's from your File Explorer
and use them in-studio for the current session. Use this to test out designs
for UI and sounds before uploading them on Roblox.

Roblox Plugin is available [here](https://www.roblox.com/library/12628397346/Quick-Asset-Prototype)

## Why not shove my assets into the contents folder like always?
This plugin allows you to easily upload it straight from the File Explorer without
extra effort. Roblox caches files, so you'll constantly be changing names too.
This plugin also automatically replaces temporary asset ids, so you don't have to.
